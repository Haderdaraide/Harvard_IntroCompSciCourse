# Harvard_IntroCompSciCourse
This is my repository to store my projects and homework assignments for my second intro course. I decided to take a second intro to really solidify a base, and the projects/technology seemed pretty interesting! 

## pset1 

The first pset was really to introduce me to the world of C/Linux

Objectives:
  1. Get comfortable with Linux
  2. Start thinking more carefully
  3. Solve some problems in C

### Hello.c 

  a hello world! And a hello to C!
  
### water.c

  a program that prompts the user for the length of shower (as a positive int), and then prints
  the equivalent number of bottles of water they are using! Take shorter showers!
  
### mario.c

  a program that 'recreates' the half-pyramid using hashes(#) for blocks. The user is prompted for the half-pyramid's
  height, a non negative integer no greater than 23. If user fails to provide what's needed, they are re-prompted
  then the half-pyramid is generated making sure to align the bottom-left corner of thehalf-pyramid with the left-hand 
  edge of the terminal window
  
  A couple of testing files are incorporated into the folder, I am debating on taking them out, but I liked 
  to see how I thought when I was working through the problem. For now, I would like to keep them there.
