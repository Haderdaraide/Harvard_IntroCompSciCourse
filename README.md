# Harvard_IntroCompSciCourse
This is my repository to store my projects and homework assignments for my second intro course. I decided to take a second intro to really solidify a base, and the projects/technology seemed pretty interesting! 

## pset1 

The first pset was really to introduce me to the world of C/Linux

Objectives:
  1. Get comfortable with Linux
  2. Start thinking more carefully
  3. Solve some problems in C

### Hello.c 

  a hello world! And a hello to C!
  
### water.c

  a program that prompts the user for the length of shower (as a positive int), and then prints
  the equivalent number of bottles of water they are using! Take shorter showers!
  
### mario.c

  a program that 'recreates' the half-pyramid using hashes(#) for blocks. The user is prompted for the half-pyramid's
  height, a non negative integer no greater than 23. If user fails to provide what's needed, they are re-prompted
  then the half-pyramid is generated making sure to align the bottom-left corner of thehalf-pyramid with the left-hand 
  edge of the terminal window
  
  A couple of testing files are incorporated into the folder, I am debating on taking them out, but I liked 
  to see how I thought when I was working through the problem. For now, I would like to keep them there. 
  
  
  
## pset2
  
The second problem set had me really get better acquainted to functions and using libraries 
  
Objectives:
  1. Become better acquainted with functions and libraries
  2. Dabble in cryptography
  
### initials.c

  A program that prompts hte user for their name, and then outputs their initials in uppercase
  no spaces or periods, and then followed by a new line. 

### caesar.c

  A program that encrpyts a message using Caesar's cipher! A secret!

### vigenere.c

  A program that encrypts a message using Vigenere's Cipher, which improves upon Caesar's by encrypting messages
  using a sequence of keys. If p is some plaintext and k is a keyword.
  
  
## pset3
  
  The Game of Fifteen! Creates our first working game! Sorting algorithns, O(n), all included and learned this week. 
  
Objectives:
  1. Accustom you to reading someone else's code
  2. Introduce you to larger programs and programs with multiple source files
  3. Empower you with Makefiles
  4. Implement a party favor
  
### Find

Prompts user for as many as MAX values until EOF is reached, 
then proceeds to search that "haystack" of values for given needle.
helpers files and make included. 

### Fifteen

Implements Game of Fifteen (generalized to d x d).
Usage: fifteen d
whereby the board's dimensions are to be d x d,
where d must be in [DIM_MIN,DIM_MAX]
